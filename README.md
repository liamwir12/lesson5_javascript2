### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. If you want to utilize and initialize a variable you can first declare it using the keyword "var" so that the function recognizes it as a local variable, then assign the variable a value.
2. Selection statements can be used to give the program different options of code that are selected based on the the value of the user's controlling expression.
3. If you want your webpage to have a drop down list, simply utilize multiple option tags under a parent node of a select tag and input their values, the first starting at "0".
